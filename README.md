# SATISPY

## Factory Game Production Optimiser

This is just a small tool to find the most Awesome Sink Points you can make
per minute. The objective function is set to the points you get for each
recipe, but this can be set to anything, so in the future I might add updates
to maximise the output of specific recipes instead of points. 

Run `py optimize.py` to output a **summary.yaml** that contains the quantities of each recipe needed.

## Currently out of Scope
This tool does not work out how to connect all of these recipies together, but that can be reverse engineered from the summary.
